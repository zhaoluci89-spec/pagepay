## Backend Tasks

### Step 1: Peyflex Service Integration
- Create `app/services/peyflex.py` with HTTP client
- Environment variables:
  ```
  PEYFLEX_API_KEY
  PEYFLEX_SECRET_KEY
  PEYFLEX_BASE_URL=https://api.peyflex.com/v1
  ```
- Authentication: Bearer token from Peyflex dashboard
- Core methods:
  - `get_airtime_networks()` → list of networks
  - `get_data_plans(network_id)` → data bundles with prices + commission
  - `get_electricity_providers()` → list of discos
  - `get_tv_providers()` → DSTV, GOtv, Startimes
  - `validate_meter(meter_number, disco)` → customer name + address
  - `validate_smartcard(iuc_number, provider)` → customer name + package
  - `purchase_airtime(phone, network, amount)` → transaction result
  - `purchase_data(phone, network, plan_id)` → transaction result
  - `purchase_electricity(meter_number, disco, amount)` → token
  - `purchase_tv(iuc_number, provider, plan_id)` → subscription confirmation

### Step 2: Bill Transaction Schema
- Table `bill_transactions` (already exists in models):
  ```
  id, user_id, service (airtime|data|electricity|tv), provider (peyflex),
  phone, meter_number, smartcard_number,
  amount_naira INTEGER (kobo), commission_naira INTEGER (kobo), points_earned INTEGER,
  reference VARCHAR UNIQUE, status (success|failed|pending),
  external_ref (Peyflex transaction ID), error_message TEXT,
  created_at
  ```
- Points calculation:
  - `commission_naira` comes from Peyflex API response
  - `points_earned = commission_naira * 0.70` (user gets 70%)
  - Platform keeps 30% of commission

### Step 3: Airtime Endpoints

  - Meter number input (validate format: 10-13 digits)
  - Disco selector dropdown
  - "Validate Meter" button → calls API, shows customer name
  - Amount input (min ₦1,000)
  - Commission preview

## Implementation Notes
1. **Commission varies by service**: Peyflex returns commission per transaction; don't hardcode rates
2. **Validation is mandatory**: Always validate meter/smartcard before purchase to prevent failed transactions
3. **Error messages**: Peyflex errors should be user-friendly, not raw API responses
4. **Testing**: Use Peyflex sandbox/test mode during development
5. **Rate limiting**: Implement per-user limits to prevent abuse (e.g., max 20 purchases/day)
6. **Receipts**: Generate PDF/image receipt for each successful purchase (Phase 9 feature)
