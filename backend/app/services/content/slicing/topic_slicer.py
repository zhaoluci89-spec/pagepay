"""Topic-aware slicer for education content (OpenStax).

Background
----------
Casual reader content (Gutenberg novels, news articles) is sliced by raw
character count — see slicer.py. The reader doesn't care about the
internal structure of the book, so a 3,000-char window snapped to the
nearest sentence works fine.

Education content is different. A student opens a calculus textbook and
expects to see "1.1 Introduction", "1.2 Limits", "1.3 Continuity" — not
six arbitrary 3,000-char windows that break mid-equation. A topic
boundary is the natural read unit: a coherent section that the student
can study, take notes on, and discuss.

This module slices OpenStax content by topic:
  - One OpenStax <h2 data-type="document-title"> or top-level <h2> =
    one topic = one child row in content_catalog.
  - Within each topic, the body is further chunked into ~2-minute
    ReadingUnits. Unit 1 of every topic is free; units 2+ are premium.

The full-stop rule
------------------
Every ReadingUnit MUST end on a sentence boundary. This is non-negotiable
for education content. The existing slicer._snap_to_boundary falls back
to paragraph breaks and forward-search when no sentence end is found;
for education we are stricter — we will not ship a slice that ends
mid-sentence. If no sentence end is found within MAX_CHARS_PER_SLICE *
1.2, we back off to the PREVIOUS sentence end (which may leave a short
unit). Better to ship a 1,800-char unit than a 2,400-char half-sentence.

OpenStax HTML structure
-----------------------
A typical OpenStax chapter has this shape:

  <div data-type="chapter">
    <h1 data-type="document-title">Chapter 1. Introduction</h1>
    <section data-type="section">
      <h2>1.1 Physics: An Introduction</h2>
      <p>...</p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="section">
      <h2>1.2 Physical Quantities and Units</h2>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>
    </section>
    ...
    <section data-type="section">
      <h2>Key Terms</h2>           <!-- dropped, not prose -->
    </section>
    <section data-type="section">
      <h2>Chapter Review</h2>      <!-- dropped, not prose -->
    </section>
  </div>

We split on <section data-type="section"> with a prose-looking <h2>
(no "Key Terms", "Key Equations", "Chapter Review", "Exercises",
"Conceptual Questions", "Problems", "Additional Problems" headings).
The chapter's <h1> becomes the parent work title; the section's <h2>
becomes the slice title.

If OpenStax changes their HTML structure, this parser will fail loudly
(logs + returns 0 children) rather than silently shipping empty slices.

    The four markers are stable strings (`[[IMG:...]]` etc.) so the
    future client can regex them out and replace with the real
    component without a re-ingest. We chose this over a richer
    inline JSON because the slicer already does sentence-end
    detection on the body — keeping the cleaned text as plain
    prose-with-sentinels is the lowest-risk path.

    Paragraph breaks are converted to blank lines (\\n\\n) so the
    sentence-end finder can recognize sentence ends that span
    paragraphs. <br> becomes a single newline. We also collapse runs
    of whitespace within a single line, but preserve the blank-line
    paragraph separators.
