"""Slice long-form content into ~2-minute reads.

Background
----------
A user opens the app to read for a few minutes and earn a little. They will
not open a 45-minute book. So books and long articles are pre-split into
short reads at import time. Each slice is its own row in `content_catalog`
with a `parent_work_id` linking back to the original source row.

Why 2 minutes (not 1, not 5)
----------------------------
- 1 minute is below the floor of meaningful reading — too short to feel like
  "I read something" and too short to host a banner ad cluster with dignity.
- 5 minutes crosses the threshold where the user feels committed. We want
  them to feel "I have a minute, I'll do one more."
- 2 minutes is the sweet spot: ~400 words, ~2,000 chars, ~5 short paragraphs.
  It fits a small phone screen with a bottom banner without dominating it.

How the slicing works
---------------------
1. Strip Project Gutenberg licensing boilerplate (the *START OF*/END OF
   markers). Their bodies are mostly legalese we don't want to bill users
   for reading.
2. Strip the Table of Contents block. Gutenberg TOCs are a hundred lines of
   "CHAPTER I." with no prose. They look like text but read like noise.
3. Split into ~2,000-char windows, snapping to the nearest paragraph break
   so we don't end a slice mid-sentence. The last slice absorbs the
   remainder (smaller is fine; it still pays).
4. Emit one row per slice with `parent_work_id`, `read_order`, and
   `total_slices` set.

    Use this when the catalog has books that were imported before slicing
    was wired in (so they're sitting as 1hr / 30min monoliths with
    `parent_work_id IS NULL` and no children) or when the slicer settings
    have changed (e.g. target size tuned from 1500 to 1000 chars).

    Returns a summary dict with parents scanned, parents re-sliced,
    and total children added. The user's `reading_progress` rows are
    pinned to `work_id` (the parent), not to specific child slice ids, so
    wiping children only invalidates `current_slice_id` pointers. The
    next `/progress/continue` will re-point to the first slice of each
    user's current work. Active `reading_session` rows are NOT touched.

    NOT used by the cron job — that runs `slice_all_books` which is
    idempotent. Reserved for the admin reslice endpoint and the client's
    lazy catalog refresh.
