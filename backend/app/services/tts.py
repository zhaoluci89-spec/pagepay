"""TTS audio generation for v3 Listen mode.

Per v3 §3.3, Listen mode narrates reading units with pre-rendered
MP3 files. The audio is generated server-side with `edge-tts` (free,
decent quality) in a batch job. The first unit of any work is free;
units 2+ require premium.

This module provides:
  - generate_audio_for_unit(): one-time generation per unit
  - batch_generate_audio_for_work(): batch job for all units in a work
  - Audio files stored at: {audio_cache_dir}/units/{unit_id}.mp3

The audio endpoint is GET /api/v1/content/audio/{unit_id}.mp3
(in routers/audio.py). Public, cached 30 days, same pattern as
the image proxy.

Voice selection: en-US-AriaNeural (Microsoft Edge TTS).
Neutral, clear, works for education content. Regional variants
(en-NG) exist but as of 2026-07 have worse prosody.

Why edge-tts and not Google Cloud TTS:
  - Free, no API key required
  - Quality sufficient for MVP
  - 200+ voices across 40+ languages (future i18n ready)
  - Can upgrade to paid TTS (ElevenLabs, OpenAI) when we hit
    Listen mode premium revenue targets (v3 §8 metrics)
