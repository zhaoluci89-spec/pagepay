"""Shared ad-credit math + helpers.

Pulled out of `routers/ads.py` so the SSV webhook and the new
`/api/v1/ads/reward-claim` endpoint reuse the exact same math, FX
fetch, and idempotency contract that the legacy `/api/v1/ads/credit`
endpoint already implements. Any change to the 95/5 share or the
FX-cache TTL goes here, not in three routers.

Unit conversion:
  - USD × fx.rate = NGN
  - NGN × USER_SHARE = user_share_ngn
  - user_share_ngn × POINTS_PER_NAIRA = points (truncated to int)

We store the FX rate in micro-units (1 USD × 1e6 = 1_000_000) for
both `fx_rate_used` and `revenue_usd` to preserve precision past
the decimal — the legacy Phase 1 AdEvent columns are already
BigInteger micro-USD, so the new endpoints stay consistent with the
old schema.
