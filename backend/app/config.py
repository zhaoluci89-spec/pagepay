    # ── Withdrawal fee tiers ────────────────────────────────────────

    # withdrawal amount and receives the full amount they requested.
    # Markup goes to the merchant (us) as profit. The user always gets
    # the full amount they typed; we eat the difference between the fee
    # they pay and the fee Paystack charges us.
    #
    # Default schedule (set in ops meeting 2026-06-30):
    #   ≤ ₦5,000          → ₦15 total user fee (Paystack ₦10, profit ₦5)
    #   ₦5,001 – ₦50,000  → ₦35 total user fee (Paystack ₦25, profit ₦10)
